I have been a on and off in web development but during the pandemic I had sometime to start developing games.

Currently, I working on simple text base rpg html game. My old projects were buried somewhere. 

So, I am starting from scratch. Beside, I still need to keep a day job since I am not making 

money developing games. I also experimenting with lots of gaming framework available. 

I might get risky and dabble into the art conjuring up an MMORPG of my own but who knows.
