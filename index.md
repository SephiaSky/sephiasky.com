Tbh, I have been on/off in game development but during the pandemic I have the time to start making games again.

Currently, I am working on simple text base rpg html game. My old projects were buried somewhere, gone. 

There is an issue where if don't document what you do. Then take long break. When you get back, you forgot how

this thing works and where you left of. I also experimenting with lots of gaming framework available. 

I might get risky and dabble into the art conjuring up an MMORPG of my own but who knows.

Also, if you want to support my work, you may do so by sending me bitcoin. 

Just go to my website www.sephiasky.com. 

If you do, please send me a tweet.
