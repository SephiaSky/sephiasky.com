I have been a on and off in web development but during the pandemic I had sometime to start developing games.

Sadly, I haven't finish most of it due to lack of funding and time. 

I still need to get some other job to finance myself.

The games I am interested in making are mostly of RPG type game for PC and HTML. 

I might get risky and dabble into the art conjuring up MMORPG of my own but who knows.
