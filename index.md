## Welcome to my Dev Blog

This page is meant to keep you up-to-date on what is currently game development. If you happen to stumble on this site by accident, here is my [website](http://www.sephiasky.com/). I am a solo game developer, primarily interested on making RPG both online and standalone.


### Starting to make HTML Games

I spent the whole day yesterday fixing issue I had with my text rpg html game.

I got it to work again. Being able to just transfer your code to new project

and not worry about re-writing the whole thing again is a great thing for devs.

Also, I am planning to make no-db MMO games with awesome replayability.

### First Ever Blog

Tbh, I have been on/off making games but during the pandemic I have the time to start developing again.

Currently, I am working on simple text only html rpg. My old projects were buried somewhere, gone. 

There is an issue where if don't document what you do. Then take a long break. When you get back, you realize

that you don't know how this thing works. I am also experimenting with lots of gaming framework available. 

I might get risky and dabble into the art conjuring up an MMORPG of my own but who knows.

Also, if you want to support my work, you may do so by sending me bitcoin. 

Just go to my website www.sephiasky.com. If you donated a btc, send me a tweet to let me know.
